**Project Overview**
This project is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to provide an immersive experience for users interested in exploring travel destinations, food options, and hotel accommodations. The app includes detailed pages for food, hotels, and luxurious experiences, featuring descriptions, images, facilities, and booking options. The goal of the app is to enhance the user's travel planning and exploration experience through a clean, intuitive, and interactive interface.

Interactive User Interface: Material Design widgets provide a modern and clean layout.
Custom Themes: The app uses a vibrant theme based on deep purple as a seed color.
Dedicated Screens for Each Category:
Food screens for specific items.
Hotel screens for specific accommodations.
Special themes like snow-themed experiences.

**Tools and Technologies Used**:
Flutter: Framework for creating cross-platform mobile applications.
Dart: Programming language used to build the application.
Material Design: For UI components and design consistency.
Widgets: Reusable components like Column, Row, Stack, Icon, ListView, and TextButton.

Code Structure
The app is designed using a declarative approach provided by Flutter, emphasizing modularity and separation of concerns. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the structure:

**main.dart:**

Entry point of the application.
Initializes the app and sets the home screen (NEW).
**Screens:**

new_screen.dart: The main screen showcasing food and hotel categories.
second_screen.dart: Secondary navigation screen for extended exploration.
**Food Category:**

**food.dart:** Displays a list of food options.
f1.dart, f2.dart, f3.dart, f5.dart: Detailed screens for specific food items with images, descriptions, and facilities.
**Hotel Category:**

hotel.dart: Displays a list of hotel options.
h1.dart, h2.dart, h3.dart, h4.dart: Detailed screens for specific hotels showcasing amenities and booking options.
**Image Screens:**

picture_1.dart and picture_2.dart: Displays image galleries for visual enhancements.
**Special Experience Screens:**

snow.dart: A snow-themed travel experience.
luxurious.dart: A luxurious-themed travel experience.
Design Pattern
The app follows a Widget Tree Structure for UI building, which is part of the declarative design paradigm. It relies on:

Stateless Widgets: For static content.
Stateful Widgets: (If interactive features like forms are added in the future).
The app can be extended to use MVVM for better separation of UI and logic.
